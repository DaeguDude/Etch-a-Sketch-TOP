# Etch-a-Sketch-TOP

### Introduction

This is Etch-a-Sketch project in The Odin Project. They said this shouldn't be
really easy, so I'll think of there's a lot of humps to be going over with, I'll
try my best to solve this problem.

<b>By the end of this project, you should be able to write what skills you have learned.</b>

### FINISHED, What have I learnt?

- How to make grid

Although I am not really good with handling grid yet, I have managed to learn to make simple a grid

- Making a lot of functions in code

I tried to make a lot of functions in the script, so it's rather explicit that what I was trying to do. However, because of a lot of functions, it is sort of mess as well. 
I'm pretty sure if I come back later at this code, I don't think I will grasp what this is in the first place.

### What can I do to more improve?

- Stop being a perfectionist

My main focus should be getting a job done, and fix it again and again. Since I'm a beginner, what I think perfect wouldn't be that perfect at other's perspective, so just get a job done and fix it multiple times
